# Chatwebsite Week 2 (+ backend)

Created a chatapp with textfile as database.

# Version 1.5 (26-01-2018)
Not fully operational. Switching from direct response system to file database. 

# Changelog
- Text file as database instead of response $content
- loads old messages

# Issues
- No id 
- mykey doesn't work with loading old messages (loads all instead from designated mykey)
- PUT request isn't allowed
- Front-end visiual bugs

# Upcoming changes
- Load messages from 1 mykey
- Fix PUT request bug so it's inline with protocol (see Swagger JSON)
